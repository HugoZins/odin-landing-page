# Reproducing a Web Design â€“ The Odin Project

This project involves recreating a complete web page based on a design provided as part of the Odin Project Foundations course (https://www.theodinproject.com/). It practices the basics of HTML and CSS, including the use of Flexbox, responsiveness, page structuring, and mockup-accurate layout.


## Project Objectives

- Structure a complete HTML page from A to Z.
- Apply CSS styles consistent with the provided design.
- Use Flexbox for a flexible layout.
- Make the site responsive for good readability on mobile.
- Correctly align images and their descriptions.
- Maintain consistent spacing between elements.
- Develop independent research skills.
- Version the project with Git and publish it via GitHub Pages.


## Page Content

The page includes:

- A header with logo and navigation.
- A hero section with a main title, a paragraph, and a button.
- A gallery of illustrations with aligned images and descriptions.
- A stylized quote with author.
- A call-to-action (CTA) section.
- A footer.


## Reference Design

The reference design is provided in the form of mockups (images) including:

- A general view of the page.
- A color and font guide.

> The text content and images are customizable as long as the structure is respected.


## Technical Notes

- The project is responsive (adapts to screen sizes) thanks to media queries.
- The descriptions below the images respect the same width as the images themselves.
- Uniform spacing is applied between each image and description.
- The CSS is contained in a single file.
- The images used are royalty-free.
